				<h1>Microwaves: Brain Fryers</h1>
				<h5>Written by Brian Flyers</h5>
				<br/>
				<p>
					&emsp; You walk into your kitchen, and what do you see? A 
					microwave, of course! And why do you see a microwave in 
					your kitchen? It doesn’t look good, it doesn’t make food taste 
					good, and it gets smelly. Well, I have found out the point of 
					the microwave. This seems totally unrealistic, but the truth is 
					that the point of microwaves is to fry your brain. Now, to the 
					average human this may sound crazy. However, according to recent 
					studies, microwaves are found to have a small radioactive microchip 
					in them that will, undoubtedly, fry the majority of your brain 
					cells. Before you go shoot or destroy your microwave, you must 
					understand that only government-issued microwaves have the ability 
					to fry your brain. To check if yours is by the government, go to 
					the documentation of your microwave, and look. These days, nearly 
					all home microwaves are approved by the government though, so you 
					are probably right to kill your microwave.
				</p>
				<p>
					&emsp; Here is a quote from Dr. Donothing, the same brain doctor who operated 
					on my friend Luke Groundwalker, “You know, ...microwaves...can...fry...your...
					more important...brain...cells...to the point…of ...stupidity...” He said all 
					of those words over the span of eleven years in that exact order.
				</p><br/>
				<h2>How does it <i>really</i> work?</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp; If you are a sciencey sort of person, this next part is for you. 
					I’m going to explain how the microwaves are able to fry our brains. The 
					government implants a microchip (right next to the round thing, and on 
					top of the square thing) in them when they are first sent out of the 
					factories. The chip, now a part of the works of the microwave, is where 
					it all happens. Whenever you press a button anywhere on the microwave, it 
					activates the chip. The chip then sends out a wave of radioactivity that 
					will reach anything within a twelve-foot (3.6576 meter) radius. The 
					radioactivity is a certain kind that only fries/destroys squishy things, e.g. 
					your brain,  your pet worm, etc. Anyway, the radioactivity finds its way in through your ear 
					holes, then to your brain. Once in your brain, it burns and fries your 
					brain cells. Now, it’s not very strong, so before you freak out, know that 
					it takes a little more than a thousand waves to fry a very tiny area of your 
					brain.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Why though?</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp; Here is the part you’ve been waiting for: the ‘why’ of this whole 
					phenomenon. We, after extensive research and surveillance, have discovered 
					the government’s reason for trying to fry your brain. This whole time, it 
					has been for secrecy. You see, the government is trying to make us citizens 
					even dumber than we already are. By frying our brain cells, they have begun 
					to make us less observant of our surroundings. That way, we won’t notice the 
					aliens, Bigfoot, alien abductions, etc. That’s right! The government is hiding 
					many things behind closed doors.
				</p><br/>
				<h2>What to do next</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp; So, now you’re wundering about what you can do about this evil 
					microwave in your house. Well, there are a few things you can do. There 
					are a few kinds of people that come from reading this article:
					<ul>
						<li>The guy who utterly destroys his microwave and then frantically searches online 
						for a non-government-approved microwave to buy instead.</li>
						<li>The person who keeps giving their microwave suspicious glares.</li>
						<li>That one guy who throws it into his garage and forgets about the microwave.</li>
						<li>The person who neatly disposes of his microwave and then never gets another 
						microwave. EVER.</li>
