					It may come as a surprise to some, but noodles were never meant to be eaten. Sadly, this is the truth behind the history of noodles, and it is a reality we should all be aware of. This blog post will explore the truth behind noodles and how their original purpose has been forgotten.
				</p><br/>
				<h2>Brief history of noodles</h2>
				<p>
					Noodles have been around for centuries, but their origin story is one shrouded in mystery. While it's believed that noodles first originated in China, the exact timeline and details of their creation are still unclear. What we do know, however, is that noodles were initially made in a secret lab - not as a food item, but as an implement used to stir toxic chemicals. It’s thought that it was only later that noodles were recognized as a type of food and began being eaten by people.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Noodles don't even taste good.</h2>
				<p>
					Most people who eat noodles expect a delicious, savory meal that is satisfying and flavorful. Unfortunately, this is not the case with noodles. Despite their popularity, noodles don't taste good. On the contrary, they often smell and taste like poop. 
				</p><p>
					When you first open a packet of noodles, the smell of the powdery substance inside is far from pleasant. It smells like a combination of chemicals and something that has been sitting in the back of your refrigerator for too long. Many people also find that when they cook noodles, the smell of them becomes even more unbearable. It's as if the odors become amplified during the cooking process. 
				</p><p>
					If the smell of noodles isn't bad enough, the taste is often just as unpleasant. Even after being cooked to perfection according to the instructions on the packaging, noodles still lack any real flavor. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that noodles are essentially just flavored poops. 
				</p><p>
					It's no wonder why so many people try to mask the taste of noodles with spices, sauces, and other condiments. Unfortunately, all these things do is mask the problem instead of solving it. No matter what you do, it's hard to make noodles taste good.
				</p>
				</p><br/>
				<h2>Dangers of eating noodles</h2>
				<p>
					We all know that noodles can be delicious when cooked correctly, but have you ever thought about the health risks of eating them? Your taste buds will indeed start to get used to eating anything over time, even if it is toxic. That’s why some people find themselves enjoying the taste of things like poop – because their taste buds have adapted to it. In extreme cases, actual poop might start to look appetizing! Beware; this should be a warning that there are hidden dangers in eating noodles and other processed foods.
				</p><br/>
				<h2>Why are noodles even popular still?</h2>
				<p>
					Noodles have been a staple in many cultures for centuries and are still widely consumed today. Despite their questionable origins, noodles have become a go-to meal for many people due to their convenience and affordability. Noodles are cheap, versatile, and can be cooked in minutes. This makes them an appealing choice for busy families, students, and those on a budget. 
				</p><p>	
					In addition, noodle dishes can be incredibly delicious, with endless flavor combinations available. People of all ages love noodles, from children eating instant ramen to adults enjoying Italian pasta dishes. This universality means that noodles are rarely going out of style. Even if you’re health-conscious or avoiding gluten, there are always alternatives such as soba noodles or rice noodles available. 
				</p><p>
					No matter the culture or cuisine, noodles will always have a place in people's diets. They might not be the healthiest option, but they are certainly one of the most convenient and beloved meals around the world.
				</p><br/>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Noodles have become a staple part of many diets around the world, but their original purpose was far from culinary. It is important to remember that noodles were not made to be eaten, but rather to stir toxic chemicals and other hazardous substances. Eating noodles may not be as dangerous as they once were, but they can still be detrimental to your health if consumed in large quantities. Additionally, they don't even taste very good! Despite all of this, noodles remain popular around the world as an easy and convenient food. We must remember the sad reality of noodles and think twice before including them in our diets.
